## Short explanation
This notebook contains my problem-solving code used to answer the various challenges posted on the website https://projecteuler.net. It is often cited as good coding practice, to get used to things like basic algorithms, data structures, optimization, and so on. Being currently registered in the Data Science certificate offered by UC Irvice, my main focus in coding practice is undoubtedly about data. On the other hand, I am starting more and more to think that a strong base with Python's built-ins will be more beneficial than just getting started with numpy, pandas, sk-learn, tensorflow -- or whatnot -- right away.

Please note, since we are using a big notebook, most problems are wrapped into individual functions. This is done for the sake of not polluting the main namespace. It has the fortunate upside of making functions available throughout all problems.
