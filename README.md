## Short explanation
This notebook contains my problem-solving code used to answer the various challenges posted on the website https://projecteuler.net. It is often cited as good coding practice, to get used to things like basic algorithms, data structures, optimization, and so on. My main focus in coding practice is undoubtedly about data, statistics, inference and knowledge discovery. On the other hand, I am starting more and more to think that a strong base with algorithms and Python's built-ins will be more beneficial than just starting in the deep end with numpy, pandas, sk-learn, tensorflow and whatnot -- right away.
