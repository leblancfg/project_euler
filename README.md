## Short explanation
This notebook contains my problem-solving code used to answer the various challenges posted on the website https://projecteuler.net. It is often cited as good coding practice, to get used to things like basic algorithms, data structures, optimization, and so on. My main focus in coding practice is undoubtedly about data, statistics, inference and knowledge discovery. On the other hand, I am starting more and more to think that a strong base in algorithms and use of Python's built-ins and  will be more beneficial than just starting in the deep end with numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, tensorflow and whatnot -- right away. Code complexity and performance when submitting to production might just we worth more in the long run.

As time goes by, I feel like I might need to come back and do problems 51-75 in numpy, both for faster data structures and manipulatability. Sideways inspiration for this practice is the Google whitepaper [Machine Learning: The High-Interest Credit Card of Technical Debt](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en/us/pubs/archive/43146.pdf).
